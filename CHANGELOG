2015-12-12 Updated examples/BasicConnectivityTest:
           - reduce message buffer to prevent crashes on 2K RAM devices
           - created constants for easy settings changes
           - brought out settings for RESET and INTERRUPT pins since these 
             can differ depending on what platform the module is built for
           - moved delays around and added a delay constant to easily change
             polling rate when debugging
